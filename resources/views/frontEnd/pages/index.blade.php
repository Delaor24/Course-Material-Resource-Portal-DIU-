			<p style="color: #343A40;justify-content: center;">Day by day we are working for an easy life. Moreover, we are trying to do a lot of work
				and gather a lot of information within a short time. And for this reason, day by day we are
				trying do so. In our project this is main concern that how our project can be more and more
				useful for those who have to use this.
				So, we made “Course Material Resource Portal” where user can get, download and upload
				every Course information that they need and they can complete some work that will be
				much easier by using this portal. It will be much more effective for the students.
				Suppose if anyone want to know their previous year question, report or anything then he
				has to search on all his previous documents so it is very difficult process for them. For
				those reason, we are developing this system for Course Materials so that they can
			maintain all their activities by software.</p>
