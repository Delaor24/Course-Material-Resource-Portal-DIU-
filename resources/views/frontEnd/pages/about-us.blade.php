			<hr>
			<p style="color: #343A40;justify-content: center;">Our country is a developing country. Day by day every sector is being developed by using
				the modern technology. Nowadays, a perfect web page is a demand and need of everybody
				who connect with a particular organization. And because of it our work can be easier and
				also it will save our time.
				This project “Course Material Resource Portal” will help all to collect any Course
				information and complete any process that is needed. This project is both for teachers
				Admins and Students. Here we have many features as like exiting system, we have some
				different features which should be in a student portal. We also have Pre-registration system
				for student and teachers .</p>
				<p style="color: #343A40;justify-content: center;">This project will help both admins and students and surely it will
				reduce some work pressure.
				So, we made “Course Material Resource Portal” where user can get, download and upload
				every Course information that they need and they can complete some work that will be
				much easier by using this portal. It will be much more effective for the students.
				Suppose if anyone want to know their previous year question, report or anything then he
				has to search on all his previous documents so it is very difficult process for them. For
				those reason, we are developing this system for Course Materials so that they can
			maintain all their activities by software.</p>
